## Simple Summary
THIS IS A TEST FOR DELETING AN EIP. This document proposes to restore the contract code 
of Ether inaccessible.

## Abstract
The `WalletLibrary` contract was used by the version to allow the
owners of the dependent multi-signature wallets regain access to their assets.

## Motivation
This proposal is necessary because the Ethereum protocol does not allow the
restoration of self-destructed contracts and there is no other simple way to

EVM semantics and tries to achieve the goal of unfreezing the funds by a single
state transition as specified in the next section.

## Specification
The self-destructed contract code at

## Rationale
The design decision to restore the `WalletLibrary` contract code in a single
state transition was made after lengthy discussions of

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal introduces backwards incompatibilities 

## Implementation
A proof-of-concept implementation is available for the Parity client on branch
